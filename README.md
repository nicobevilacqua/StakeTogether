## What is Stake Together

Stake Together is a platform that allows people to participate in decentralized crowdfunding for running Ethereum Validators in Latin America.

Participants are able to stake any amount of ETH. When the 32 ETH required to run a validator is reached, a call is made to the infrastructure provider to run the validator on their behalf. After a specified staking period, the validator earns their staking rewards and they are then distributed proportionally between the participants.

## The Problem

Most Ethereum nodes are run the United States and Europe [¹](https://ethernodes.org/countries) [²](https://bitnodes.io/). This is true even for decentralized protocols like Lido Finance[³](https://lido.fi/scorecard) and RocketPool[⁴](https://stake.rocketpool.net/network).

That represents a serious challenge for the **geographical decentralization of the network**.
